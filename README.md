# portfolio-site
Built a portfolio site to display my projects more easily.

## Technologies

1. CSS
2. HTML
3. Javascript 

## HTML 

1. cdnjs for normalizing the font across browsers
2. cdnjs font-awesome

## CSS

The following is to improve the readability of the CSS classes in the code.
1. Double underscore "__" in classes to represent sub-classes
2. Double dash "--" in classes to represent a modifier class

Notes: 
*CSS Native variables can be changed within a media query*

*Generally you could make your reponsive design based on 300px+, 600px+, and 900px+ instead of focusing on specific devices. That may change if you have a specific target audience.*

*Using absolute positioning is far more rigid and makes it difficult to write layouts that respond well to changing content.*

*Have 2 media queries per section to deal with the layout*
